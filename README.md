MIPS_SCANNER
============

In this project we will validate the syntax of a few MIPS instructions.  In later assignments we will expand the instruction repertoire.   The instructions are: add, addi, beq, j, and the definition and use of labels.   More info on the sytax of these instructions is in Appendix B of your textbook. You should check for validity of register names and the size of immediate operands in the context of the instruction. Labels can be alphanumeric upto 16 characters long.  A label by itself followed by a colon is a valid statement.  Example run: Please enter a MIPS statement: abc: label: abc  Please enter a MIPS statement: beq $s1, $s2, abcxyz operator: beq op1: register $s1 op2: register $s2 op3: label abcxyz  Please enter a MIPS statement: beq $s1, $s2, 10000000 operator: beq  op1: register $s1  op2: register $s2  op3: Error: immediate op out of range  Please enter a MIPS statement: addi $s1, $s2, $s3  operator: addi  op1: register $s1  op2: register $s2  op3: Error: immediate expected
